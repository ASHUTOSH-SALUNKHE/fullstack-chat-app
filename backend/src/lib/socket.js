//What it does: This creates a Node.js HTTP server and binds it to the Express application (app).
//Purpose: Socket.IO requires a raw HTTP server to attach itself for handling WebSocket connections. The server variable now represents an HTTP server that supports both regular HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.

    cors: {

//What it does:Creates a Socket.IO server and attaches it to the server object.Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from http://localhost:5173 (likely the clientâ€™s development server).
//Purpose:Socket.IO listens for incoming WebSocket connections on the server.The cors option ensures that only requests from the specified origin (your client) are allowed to connect.

//The io.on("connection") event fires whenever a client connects to the Socket.IO server.
//socket represents the unique connection to that specific client. Each client gets its own socket object.
//The socket.id is a unique identifier assigned to each connected client by Socket.IO.
//The disconnect event fires when a client disconnects (e.g., closes their browser tab or loses their internet connection).
//socket.id identifies which client disconnected.
